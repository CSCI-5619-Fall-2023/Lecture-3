# Lecture 3: Getting Started with VR Development

In this lecture, I will introduce the VR development pipeline and demonstrate how to create simple virtual environments using the Godot Engine.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this lecture, you will first need to install:

- [Godot Engine 4.1.1](https://godotengine.org/) -  We will be using the standard version in class, which only supports GDScript. However, you may optionally install the .NET version if you would also like to use C# in your assignments.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I also recommend you install the following useful VS Code extensions:

- [godot-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geequlim.godot-tools) - Make sure you use "Open Folder" and select your entire project folder for this to work properly!
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - Useful for source control within VS Code.
